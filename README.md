- 👋 Hi, I’m @biniciobarrueco, Industrial Civil Engineer
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Analytics and a bit of UI desktop apps development.  
- 🌱 I’ve learning Pyhton for almost three years and its libraries for data science, now reinforcing SQL and learning to use ORM's
- 💞️ I’m looking for my first job in this IT field or collaborate to meet people who have the same interests, and maybe to be part of a team in these fields of IT
